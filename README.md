# Content reuse in Gatsby demo

This repo demonstrates methods of content reuse in a Gatsby site using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). It includes examples of:

* **Transclusion** - Insert Markdown content from a snippet file into one or more pages. Updating the snippet updates the content wherever it's used.
* **Variables** - Change a variable's value to update all instances of the variable globally, or pass a variable value into a snippet.
* **Conditional content** - Render a block of content only if a variable has a certain value (that is, only if a certain condition is met).

To check out the content reuse examples, run the site and view the `/blog` pages. See comments in the code for more details.

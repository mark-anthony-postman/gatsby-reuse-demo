# GitHub

Back up your Postman collections to GitHub, a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, with the Postman to GitHub integration.

Setting up a GitHub integration requires you to generate a GitHub personal access token and configure how you would like to back up your collections.

## Backing up collections on GitHub

 You can back up a Postman Collection to a GitHub repository. After you create the integration, any new changes to the collection in Postman will also appear in the GitHub repository.

<SearchIntegration integration="GitHub" />

1. Enter your GitHub **Personal Access Token** and select **Authenticate and Proceed**.

# GitHub

Back up your Postman collections to GitHub, a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, with the Postman to GitHub integration.

Setting up a GitHub integration requires you to generate a GitHub personal access token and configure how you would like to back up your collections.

## Backing up collections on GitHub

 You can back up a Postman Collection to a GitHub repository. After you create the integration, any new changes to the collection in Postman will also appear in the GitHub repository.

{/* Include the imported snippet and pass a value for the "integration" variable */}

<IntegrationSnippet integration="GitHub" />

4. Next to **Backup a collection**, select **Add Integration**.
1. Enter your GitHub **Personal Access Token** and select **Authenticate and Proceed**.
1. Enter your GitHub **Personal Access Token** and select **Authenticate and Proceed**.
1. After Postman verifies the token, you can configure the integration:

   * Give the integration a nickname.
   * Select the workspace with the collection you want to back up.
   * Select a collection to back up.
   * Select the GitHub repository where you want to back up the collection.
   * Enter the directory where you want to push the collection. If the directory doesn't exist, Postman will create it for you. If you don't specify a directory, Postman will create a `Postman Collections` directory.
   * Enter the file name of the collection in the repository.
   * Enter the branch where you want to push the collection. The branch must already exist in your repository. If you don't specify a branch, Postman will push the collection to the default branch of the repository.
1. To finish setting up the integration, select **Add Integration**.

{/* Import a snippet and the constants file. Also import react-markdown to use Markdown inside JSX. */}

This page shows examples of conditional content rendering.

### One line conditional (JSX)

{/* This construction works for one line of text. It can't be used for a few words within a line as it creates a line break before and after. */}

{constants.version == "v10" ? <p>This is some conditional text for v10.</p> : null }

{constants.version == "v9" ? <p>This is some different conditional text for v9.</p> : null }

{/* You can also replace 'null' with content that will show if the condition is false. */}

{constants.version == "v10" ? <p>If version is v10, show this.</p> : <p>If version is not v10, show this.</p> }

### Image conditional

{/* You can also use conditionals with images, for example, to show screenshots for specific app versions. */}

{constants.version == "v9" ? <img alt="Adding existing API documentation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-add-api-docs-v9.jpg" width="100%" /> : null }

{constants.version == "v10" ? <img alt="Adding existing API documentation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/documentation-add-api-docs-v10-0-5.jpg" width="100%" /> : null }

### Snippet conditional

{/* Inserting a snippet in a conditional works fine, and the snippet can have muiltple lines of Markdown */}

{constants.version == "v10" ? <Snippet3 /> : null }

### Multi-line conditional (JSX)

{/* You can put multiple lines of JSX in a conditional if you wrap them in <div> tags */}

{constants.version == "v10" ?
<div>
    <p>This is a conditional list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>List item</li>
        <li>List item</li>
    </ul>
</div>
: null }

### One line conditional (react-markdown)

{/* To use Markdown inside a conditional, you need to wrap it in <ReactMarkdown> tags */}

{constants.version == "v10" ?
<ReactMarkdown>This is a test with **react-markdown**. It _kinda_ works, but for one line only.</ReactMarkdown>
: null }

### Multi-line conditional (react-markdown)

{/* You can have multiple <ReactMarkdown> lines if you wrap them in a <div> tag, but the result isn't good. In this case, each list item gets places in its own list in the output. */}

{(() => {
if (constants.version == "v10"){
    return (
        <div>
            <ReactMarkdown>This is another test with **react-markdown**. Using a `div` lets you put in mulitple lines, but list items each get rendered in a separate list.</ReactMarkdown>
            <ReactMarkdown>* List item</ReactMarkdown>
            <ReactMarkdown>* List item</ReactMarkdown>
        </div>
    )
}
return null;
})()}
